Relevance-Feedback
==================

This is an implement of an information retrieval system that exploits user-provided relevance feedback to improve the search results returned by Bing. The relevance feedback mechanism is based on the seminal paper "Singhal: Modern Information Retrieval: A Brief Overview, IEEE Data Engineering Bulletin, 2001". A copy of the research paper can be found here: http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~gravano/cs6111/Readings/singhal.pdf
